# deploy-it-to-swarm

My own deploy it for docker swarm stacks. Before that I've used simple bash script which deployed stack to my swarm nodes. This was hacky and not error prone. Everything was hardcoded and there was lack of checks to be sure that configuration is valid.

It's named after my basic script: `deploy_it`
